    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h4>Dough</h4>
        </li>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Pour warm water into a large bowl, and sprinkle yeast ontop and rest for 5 minutes. Stir in some cold
                    water and salt, as well as flour (1 cup at a time) until fully mixed.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Spread flour on a surface, and knead dough until smooth (around 10 minutes).
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Cut the dough in half to form two dough balls and coat with olive oil. Put in refrigerator for at
                    least 16 hours in a sealed container to allow dough to rise.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Whenever you are going to make the pizza, remove the dough from the fridge an hour before using.

            <h4>Assembly</h4>
        </li>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven with a pizza stone to about 550F</li>
            <li>
                <p>Prepare one dough ball by dusting with flour and streach to about 14 inches in diameter. Place on a
                    cooking sheet or pizza peel.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Put half of the mozzarella on the dough and sprinle oregano, and pepper on top. Add the tomatoes and
                    drizzle some olive oil over it all.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Once assembled, place the pizza on the stone inside the preheated oven for about 4-6 minutes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Remove pizza from oven after crust is golden brown, sprinkle the basil and serve!</p>
            </li>
